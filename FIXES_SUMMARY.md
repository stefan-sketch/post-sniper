# Post Sniper Railway Deployment - Fixes Summary

## Date: October 20, 2025

## Problem
Post Sniper was deployed to Railway but was not fetching or displaying any posts from the Fanpage Karma API, despite successful API responses.

## Root Cause
**API Response Parsing Error**: The background job was looking for posts in the wrong location within the API response structure.

### Original (Incorrect) Code
```javascript
const posts = response.data?.data || [];
```

### Correct Code
```javascript
const posts = response.data?.data?.posts || [];
```

### API Response Structure
The Fanpage Karma API returns:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      { "id": "...", "message": "...", "kpi": {...}, ... }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Response Parsing (`server/backgroundJob.ts`)
- **Line 187**: Changed from `response.data?.data || []` to `response.data?.data?.posts || []`
- Removed excessive debug logging
- Added simple post count logging

### 2. Removed UI Elements (`client/src/pages/Home.tsx`)
- Removed timer countdown display
- Removed green/red status indicator icon
- Kept essential controls: Settings, Play/Pause, Fetch Now, Alerts

### 3. Database Initialization (`server/initDb.ts`)
- Changed from DROP TABLE approach to CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
- Prevents data loss on every deployment
- Preserves monitored pages and settings across deployments

### 4. Environment Configuration (`server/_core/env.ts`)
- Added hardcoded Fanpage Karma API token as fallback
- Token: `2a10FtrIfe10OnZN0C5l1s1qee600GpER2RylNPNuD47RXs8frGfuB`

### 5. Railway Compatibility Fixes
- Fixed OAuth initialization to be optional
- Made environment variables optional with defaults
- Fixed production static file paths
- Fixed vite.config.ts to use `fileURLToPath` instead of `import.meta.dirname`

## Testing Checklist

When the user returns, they should:

1. âœ… Wait for Railway deployment to complete (1-2 minutes)
2. âœ… Refresh the Post Sniper URL
3. âœ… Verify the page is configured: Profile ID `114022587858511` (Football Funnys)
4. âœ… Click "Fetch Now" button (ðŸ”„)
5. âœ… Check Railway logs for: `[BackgroundJob] Fetched X posts for profile 114022587858511`
6. âœ… Verify posts appear in the Live Posts column
7. âœ… Verify posts appear in the Popular Posts column
8. âœ… Verify engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares) are displayed
9. âœ… Verify post images are loading
10. âœ… Verify clicking on posts opens Facebook links

## Expected Log Output

```
[InitDB] Initializing database tables...
[InitDB] Updated existing table schemas
[InitDB] âœ… Database tables initialized successfully!
[BackgroundJob] Starting background job service
[BackgroundJob] Fetching posts...
[BackgroundJob] Fetched X posts for profile 114022587858511
[BackgroundJob] Cached X posts for Football Funnys
[BackgroundJob] Successfully fetched and cached all posts
```

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow
1. **Background Job** (runs every 10 minutes)
   - Fetches posts from Fanpage Karma API
   - Stores in PostgreSQL `cached_posts` table
   - Creates alerts if thresholds are exceeded

2. **Frontend** (polls every 5 seconds)
   - Queries `cachedPosts.getAll` tRPC endpoint
   - Gets posts from database (not API)
   - Displays in Live Posts and Popular Posts columns

3. **Manual Fetch** (on-demand)
   - User clicks Fetch Now button
   - Triggers immediate background job run
   - Frontend refetches from database

### Benefits
- âœ… Single API call serves all users
- âœ… Data persists across page refreshes
- âœ… No client-side API keys
- âœ… Automatic updates every 10 minutes
- âœ… Instant page loads (data from database)

## Files Modified

1. `server/backgroundJob.ts` - Fixed API response parsing
2. `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` - Removed timer and status icon
3. `server/initDb.ts` - Fixed database initialization
4. `server/_core/env.ts` - Added API token
5. `server/_core/index.ts` - Made OAuth optional
6. `server/_core/vite.ts` - Fixed production paths
7. `vite.config.ts` - Fixed import.meta.dirname issue

## Deployment Status

**Deployed to Railway**: âœ…  
**Commit**: `c931231` - "Fixed API response parsing - correct path is response.data.data.posts"  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/stefan-sketch/post-sniper

## Next Steps

1. User tests the deployment
2. If working: Remove debug logging for cleaner logs
3. If not working: Check Railway logs and database connection
4. Consider adding error notifications in UI
5. Consider adding "last updated" timestamp in UI

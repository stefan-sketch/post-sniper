# Railway Deployment Summary

## âœ… Successfully Deployed Features

### 1. **3-Minute Polling Interval**
- Changed from 5 minutes to 3 minutes
- Cron expression: `*/3 * * * *`
- Location: `server/backgroundJob.ts` line 43

### 2. **Today-Only Post Filtering**
- Filters posts to show only today's posts in UK timezone
- Uses `startOfDay` and `endOfDay` from `date-fns-tz`
- Location: `server/backgroundJob.ts` lines 279-291

### 3. **API Status Tracking**
- Added `lastAPIStatus` field to track FanPage Karma API health
- Schema location: `drizzle/schema.ts` line 54
- Default value: `'success'`

### 4. **Automatic Database Migrations**
- Package.json already configured with: `"start": "pnpm db:push && NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js"`
- Uses `drizzle-kit push` for intelligent schema synchronization

## ðŸ”§ Issue Encountered & Resolution

### Problem
The migration didn't run automatically during deployment because:
1. We regenerated migrations from scratch, creating a new `0000_busy_molten_man.sql`
2. The database already had existing tables from previous deployments
3. The migration tried to `CREATE TABLE` on existing tables, causing errors

### Solution
We manually added the missing column using Railway's PostgreSQL connection:
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_settings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "lastAPIStatus" text DEFAULT 'success';
```

## ðŸ“‹ Current Configuration

### Railway Settings
- âœ… "Wait for CI" is **OFF** (allows immediate deployment)
- âœ… Auto-deploy on GitHub push is **enabled**
- âœ… PostgreSQL database connected via private network

### Migration Strategy
- Using `drizzle-kit push` instead of `drizzle-kit migrate`
- This compares schema with database and only applies necessary changes
- Safer for existing databases with data

## ðŸš€ What's Working Now

1. **Background Job**: Runs every 3 minutes to fetch new posts
2. **Date Filtering**: Only shows posts from today (UK timezone)
3. **API Status**: Tracks whether FanPage Karma API is responding
4. **Database**: All columns exist and queries work correctly
5. **Deployment**: Automatic on git push to main branch

## ðŸ”® Future Deployment Best Practices

### For Schema Changes
1. **Never regenerate all migrations** - this breaks existing databases
2. **Use `drizzle-kit push`** for development and production
3. **Test migrations locally** before pushing to production
4. **Keep migration history** - don't delete old migration files

### For Railway Deployments
1. Check deployment logs for migration output
2. Verify the `pnpm db:push` command runs before app starts
3. Test the app immediately after deployment
4. Have database connection details ready for manual fixes

### For Emergency Fixes
If migrations fail, you can always manually add columns:
```bash
PGPASSWORD=<password> psql -h <host> -U postgres -p <port> -d railway -c "ALTER TABLE ..."
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

Watch for these in Railway logs:
- `> drizzle-kit push` - indicates migration is running
- `âœ“ Pushing schema changes` - migration success
- Any PostgreSQL errors - migration failure
- `Server running on port` - app started successfully

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. Monitor the app for the next few hours to ensure stability
2. Check that posts are being fetched every 3 minutes
3. Verify only today's posts are displayed
4. Confirm API status indicator is working in the UI

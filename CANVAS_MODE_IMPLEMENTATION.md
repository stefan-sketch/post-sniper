## Commits Pushed to GitHub

### Commit 1: Canvas Mode Feature (38c90af)
**feat: Add Canvas Mode for tweet overlay images with colored borders**

#### New File: `client/src/components/CanvasEditor.tsx`
- **207 lines** of clean, simple implementation
- **Step-by-step workflow**:
  - Step 1: Upload background image
  - Step 2: Upload tweet screenshot
  - Step 3: Select outline color (Blue/Gold/Orange/None)
- **Proper layering**: Tweet image renders ON TOP of background (lines 63-73)
- **8px colored outline** based on selected page
- **Canvas dimensions**: 1080×1350px (Instagram-optimized)
- **Tweet scaling**: 50% of canvas width, centered

#### Modified: `client/src/components/CreatePostDialog.tsx`
- Added `CanvasEditor` import
- Added `Sparkles` icon import
- Added `canvasMode` state variable
- Added Canvas button in upload area (top-left position)
- Conditional rendering of CanvasEditor when canvasMode is true
- onComplete callback to set final image and exit Canvas mode

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Clean, guided UX with clear step progression
- ✅ Automatic advancement through steps
- ✅ Real-time canvas preview
- ✅ High-quality image output (PNG format)
- ✅ Proper z-index layering (background → tweet → outline)

### Commit 2: Button Size Fix (ddb2f87)
**fix: Increase social media button size to prevent icon cutoff**

#### Modified: `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`
- Changed button size: `h-8 w-8` → `h-10 w-10` (32px → 40px)
- Adjusted icon sizes:
  - Facebook: `w-3.5 h-3.5` → `w-4 h-4` (14px → 16px)
  - X (Twitter): `w-2.5 h-2.5` → `w-3 h-3` (10px → 12px)
  - Reddit: `w-3.5 h-3.5` → `w-4 h-4` (14px → 16px)

**Result**: scale-110 effect (44px) now fits properly without clipping icons

## Technical Details

### Canvas Mode Workflow
1. User clicks "Canvas" button in upload area
2. CanvasEditor component renders with white canvas
3. User uploads background image → auto-advances to Step 2
4. User uploads tweet screenshot → auto-advances to Step 3
5. User selects outline color → generates final image
6. Final image set as post image, Canvas mode exits

### Drawing Order (Critical for Layering)
```javascript
1. White background (fillRect)
2. Background image (drawImage - cover fit)
3. Tweet overlay image (drawImage - centered, 50% width)
4. Colored outline (strokeRect - 8px width)
```

### Outline Colors
- **Blue (#1877F2)**: Facebook / Footy Feed
- **Gold (#FFD700)**: Football Funnys
- **Orange (#FF4500)**: Football Away Days / Reddit
- **None**: No outline

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test Canvas Mode workflow:
   - Click Canvas button in Create Post dialog
   - Upload a background image (e.g., stadium photo)
   - Upload a tweet screenshot
   - Select each outline color option
   - Verify final image has proper layering
2. Test button scaling:
   - Switch between Facebook/X/Reddit tabs
   - Verify icons are not cut off when selected
   - Check on different screen sizes

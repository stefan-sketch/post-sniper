# Image Expansion & Link Button Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added image expansion (lightbox/modal) and external link buttons to all feed cards across the Post Sniper dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Image Expansion Modal
All feed cards now support clicking on images to view them in a full-screen lightbox modal with:
- Black semi-transparent backdrop (90% opacity)
- Centered image display with max width/height constraints
- Click outside to close
- Close button (X) in top-right corner
- Prevents event propagation to avoid unwanted navigation

### 2. External Link Buttons
Each feed card now has a small link button in the top-right corner that opens the original post:
- **Facebook posts** (Live & Popular): Opens Facebook post
- **Twitter posts**: Opens tweet on X/Twitter
- **Reddit posts**: Opens Reddit post

### 3. UI Improvements
- Made Reddit sort button smaller (height: 20px, text: 10px) to match other column headers
- Centered Popular column header in 3-column mode by hiding the TrendingUp icon
- Improved visual consistency across all columns

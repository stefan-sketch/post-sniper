# Railway Deployment Guide for Post Sniper üéØ

This guide will help you deploy Post Sniper to Railway with PostgreSQL database and automatic background data refreshing.

## What's Changed

### Server-Side Architecture
- **Background Job Service**: Fetches posts from Fanpage Karma API every 10 minutes automatically
- **Cached Posts**: All posts stored in PostgreSQL database for instant access
- **Shared Data**: All users see the same data (no per-user fetching)
- **Always Running**: Data refreshes even when no one is browsing the site

### Database Migration
- **From**: MySQL/SQLite
- **To**: PostgreSQL (Railway's recommended database)
- **New Table**: `cached_posts` stores all fetched posts

### Client Updates
- Client now polls cached data every 5 seconds (lightweight)
- No more client-side API calls to Fanpage Karma
- Faster page loads and better performance

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Railway Account
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub (recommended)

### 2. Create New Project
1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect your GitHub account and select the `post-sniper` repository
4. Railway will automatically detect the configuration

### 3. Add PostgreSQL Database
1. In your Railway project, click "+ New"
2. Select "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically create a PostgreSQL instance
4. The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable will be automatically set

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
In your Railway project settings, add these environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=(automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL)
```

**Optional**: If you want to set a custom port (Railway handles this automatically):
```
PORT=3000
```

### 5. Initialize Database Schema
After the first deployment, you need to run the database migrations:

1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Deploy"
4. Add a "Build Command" (if not already set):
   ```
   pnpm install && pnpm run build
   ```
5. The database schema will be created automatically on first connection

Alternatively, you can run migrations manually:
```bash
# In Railway CLI or deployment logs
pnpm db:push
```

### 6. Configure Post Sniper
1. Once deployed, visit your Railway app URL
2. Click the Settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è)
3. Add your Fanpage Karma API token
4. Add monitored Facebook pages with their profile IDs
5. Set alert thresholds if desired

### 7. Verify Background Job
Check the deployment logs to confirm the background job is running:
```
[BackgroundJob] Starting background job service
[BackgroundJob] Fetching posts...
[BackgroundJob] Cached X posts for [Page Name]
```

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Description | Default |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string | Auto-set by Railway |
| `NODE_ENV` | Yes | Environment mode | `production` |
| `PORT` | No | Server port | `3000` |

## Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database includes these tables:

- **users**: User authentication (minimal, uses "public" user)
- **monitored_pages**: Facebook pages to monitor
- **user_settings**: App settings and API tokens
- **alerts**: Triggered alerts for high-performing posts
- **cached_posts**: ‚≠ê NEW - Stores all fetched posts with metadata

## Background Job Behavior

- **Frequency**: Runs every 10 minutes
- **Data Retention**: Keeps posts from last 24 hours
- **Alert Checking**: Automatically creates alerts for posts exceeding thresholds
- **API Efficiency**: Single API call per page every 10 minutes (vs. per-user calls)

## Monitoring

### Check if Background Job is Running
View Railway logs:
```
[BackgroundJob] Successfully fetched and cached all posts
```

### Check Database Status
Railway provides a built-in database dashboard:
1. Click on your PostgreSQL service
2. Go to "Data" tab
3. View `cached_posts` table

### Performance Metrics
- **Client Load**: ~5KB per poll (cached data only)
- **Server Load**: Minimal - background job runs independently
- **Database**: Optimized queries with indexes

## Troubleshooting

### Background Job Not Running
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
- Ensure Fanpage Karma API token is configured in settings

### No Posts Showing
- Wait 10 minutes for first background job run
- Check that monitored pages are configured
- Verify API token is valid

### Database Connection Errors
- Railway PostgreSQL must be in the same project
- Check `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Restart the service if needed

## Cost Estimation

Railway Pricing (as of 2025):
- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month
  - Includes: 512MB RAM, shared CPU
  - PostgreSQL: 1GB storage included
  - Perfect for Post Sniper

- **Pro Plan**: $20/month
  - Includes: 8GB RAM, dedicated resources
  - PostgreSQL: 8GB storage
  - For heavy usage

## Differences from Manus Deployment

| Feature | Manus Version | Railway Version |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Database | SQLite (file-based) | PostgreSQL (managed) |
| Data Fetching | Client-side | Server-side background job |
| Scaling | Single instance | Auto-scaling ready |
| Data Sharing | Per-browser session | Global shared cache |
| Persistence | Local file | Cloud database |

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. ‚úÖ Configure your Fanpage Karma API token
2. ‚úÖ Add monitored pages
3. ‚úÖ Wait 10 minutes for first data fetch
4. ‚úÖ Share the Railway URL with your team
5. ‚úÖ Everyone sees the same real-time data!

**Note**: Your current Manus deployment at https://postsniper-wgf4yeqf.manus.space/ will continue to work independently. The Railway deployment is a separate instance with its own database.
